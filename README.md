# 💡 Machine Learning Algorithm Implementations

This repository contains Python implementations of **20 classic machine learning algorithms and mini-projects**. Each algorithm is implemented in its own folder with a clear structure and documentation.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each folder includes:

- ✅ A Python script implementing the algorithm  
- 📄 `README.md` with instructions  
- 📦 `requirements.txt` listing dependencies  
- 🚫 `.gitignore` to avoid unnecessary files

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

You can install the required packages for **each algorithm separately** from its folder, or create a global environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # from inside each folder
```

Or combine all into a common `requirements.txt`.
